# Fake_News_Prediction_Uing_NLP
This project involves the development of a machine learning(NLP) model to detect fake news.The dataset used for this project contains labeled news articles, allowing the model to differentiate between real and fake news. Several algorithms were evaluated to identify the best-performing model.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
models: Saved models and evaluation results.
results: Results including confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy with the following confusion matrix:

Predicted True	Predicted Fake
True	4154	43
Fake	56	4685
The ROC curve for the Logistic Regression model shows an AUC of 1.00, indicating excellent performance.
